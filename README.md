This project is an exercise in using html and css, I am creating a copy of the google homepage, in looks only, I am not copying the search function. 

After finishing this project I have learned that it is difficult at first to replicate the style to a tee of a website but it was very interesting trying to figure out how to align everything properly so it looks good.
